# Smoothboard Stylers

## What is Smoothboard Stylers?

Smoothboard stylers is an assignment given to me at school. It's about creating a simple webshop/showcase for a company making custom surfboards. The website should allow them to provide information about their company and what they do. They also want to showcase some of their boards and allow customers to contact them for an appointment if they are interested.

## Build in Laravel

I've chosen to build this website in Laravel, originally the assignment stated it to be build in ASP.NET . However, due to my extensive interest in the Laravel framework I discussed the possibility of creating it differently. It's been a great learning experience and a good refresher. The website is still missing a few things, you'll see that some styling is not very supportive for mobile as to this is not included in the scope of the assignment. I've tried to leverage most of the techniques that make Laravel unique, but some are still missing.
